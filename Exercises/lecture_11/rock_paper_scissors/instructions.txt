The code consists of 2 files - game.py and agent.py
The code that implements the actual game is coded in game.py
agent.py define several agents that can play the game.

1. Finish the implementation of game.py by implementing the compare function, 
updating the scores (where a win is 1 point, a tie or a loss is 0 points)
and finally the summary function that gives some information after the game.

2. Implement the HumanAgent in agent.py. This agent should query the user
for the next move and ensure that the user gives valid input.

3. implement MyAgent, where you can implement your own strategy, 
try to beat the InstructorAgent consistently after 100 rounds.
